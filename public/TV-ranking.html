<h1>The best TV-series according to me</h1>
<h2>My top 3 TV-series of all-time</h2>
<p>Not really, but these are really good tho</p>

<hr />

<h3>Lucifer</h3>
<p>Demons, Angels, superpowers and crime scene investigations. Whats not to like</p>

<h3>Overlord</h3>
<p>Isekai anime, overpowered MC skeleton who do as he pleases. Fun and entertaining</p>

<h3>Arifuerta</h3>
<p>Another Isekai anime, fell to the bottom of the pit where no-one has never been.
Raised back up to the surface with great powers and wants to kill God. Really good. </p>
